This is ZMK firmware configuration for my Lilly58. A few things that shape my configuration priorities:

- I'm a dvorak typist
- I code mostly in Elixir, with some Typescript and occasionally C#.
- I'm a native English speaker learning German, so sometimes need easy access to umlaut characters.
- I regularly use my keyboard with Windows, Mac, and Android
- I value very fast typing. Switching layers (including using Shift) is relatively slow and cumbersome. This is why (for now?) 58 keys is a minimum since numbers, especially in programming, are so common.

## Notes

- Because switching layers is relatively slow, prefer combos as much as possible.
  - Prefer horizontal combos. Vertical combos reserved for less common, less speed sensitive characters (such as F1-F12).
- For over a decade I used special layers or autohotkey scripts to switch my layout to qwerty when using modifiers, primarily to keep Ctrl + C, V, X, and Z in the qwerty location. However this honestly makes it hard to learn and use other keyboard shortcuts because I don't have muscle memory for any other qwerty keys.
  - To fix this, no more special DVORAKQWERTY layer. Going forward use dvorak key location for shortcuts
  - Plus dedicated macro combos for my most common keyboard shortcuts, usually on my non mouse hand, such as copy, cut, paste, etc
- Home row mods are not for me. I have too much muscle memory with Ctrl & shift, and enough thumb keys to cover all my modifier needs without needing to deal with hacks and timing.
- Currently switching between the qwerty gaming layer and dvorak for typing is really cumbersome. Is there a very fast way I can switch between gaming and typing?
